Answer questions about this review concern.

## Steps

When no question follows this paste, explain this review concern.

1. Resolve the pinned SHAs.
   Run `git rev-parse --verify 3e1dd092b1939420d40648029dee3881f9e4842b` and `git rev-parse --verify 9d671384dbb819d16682adc129c7e1e2ea8547a5` in this repository.
   Done when both objects exist.

2. Load the hunks.
   A hunk ref is a pointer into the live git diff at the pinned SHAs.
   For each hunk ref, run `git diff --find-renames 3e1dd092b1939420d40648029dee3881f9e4842b 9d671384dbb819d16682adc129c7e1e2ea8547a5 -- <path>` and keep the hunk whose header matches the @@ range.
   Done when every hunk ref has a matching live hunk.

3. Answer from live git.
   Read those hunks. Use the why and the what as interpretation. Live git wins when they disagree.
   When you show code, quote the live git lines.
   Done when the answer quotes the live code.

Review concern 04 of 07: QuickJS CONFIG_VERSION from the submodule (`quickjs`)

The why:

The hard-coded `2024-01-13` was independent of the submodule ([#52](source:s1)).

The what:

CMake reads the first line of `vendor/quickjs/VERSION` into `CONFIG_VERSION` and reconfigures when that file changes.
