Answer questions about this review concern.

## Steps

When no question follows this paste, explain this review concern.

1. Resolve the pinned SHAs.
   Run `git rev-parse --verify 72e2e3ce9d7c99bb8015c05d4fea7d41a9a69995` and `git rev-parse --verify b0a30605c0c10bd3393bb263b9ce286e06f29813` in this repository.
   Done when both objects exist.

2. Load the hunks.
   A hunk ref is a pointer into the live git diff at the pinned SHAs.
   For each hunk ref, run `git diff --find-renames 72e2e3ce9d7c99bb8015c05d4fea7d41a9a69995 b0a30605c0c10bd3393bb263b9ce286e06f29813 -- <path>` and keep the hunk whose header matches the @@ range.
   Done when every hunk ref has a matching live hunk.

3. Answer from live git.
   Read those hunks. Use the why and the what as interpretation. Live git wins when they disagree.
   When you show code, quote the live git lines.
   Done when the answer quotes the live code.

Review concern 10 of 11: Harnesses drop the define (`mirrors-2`)

Part: stb_ds once

The why:

These harnesses get stb_ds through `instance_fixture.h` or use it directly, so only the define goes.

The what:

The same one-line removal of `#define STB_DS_IMPLEMENTATION` repeats; read one and skip the rest.

Depends on:
- 06 stb_ds implementation in vitadeck_core (`stb-ds`)

- tests/input_harness.c
- tests/layout_harness.c
