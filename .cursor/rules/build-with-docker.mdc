# PSVita Build Steps

Always build the project inside the Docker Compose environment.

- Run configuration + build in one shot: `docker-compose run --rm vitasdk bash -lc "cmake -S . -B out && cmake --build out"`
- To rebuild after changes: `docker-compose run --rm vitasdk bash -lc "cmake --build out"`
- The working directory inside the container is `/build/git`, which maps to the repo root.
- Outputs (e.g. `vitadeck.vpk`) are written to `out/` in the host workspace.
