# JavaScript Runtime Build

Build and typecheck the JS runtime separately from the native app.

- Install dependencies once: `pnpm install` (run inside `js/`)
- Build JS runtime: `pnpm --dir js build`
- Typecheck only: `pnpm --dir js tsc`
- Watch mode (dev): `pnpm --dir js dev`

Outputs:
- Bundled files are written to `js/dist/`.
- During native builds, CMake copies `js/dist/` to `out/js/`.

Notes:
- The CMake target `js_build` calls `pnpm build` in `js/`.
- On macOS native runs, the executable in `out/vitadeck` loads JS from `out/js/`.
