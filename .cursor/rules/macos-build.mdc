# macOS Build Steps

Build the project natively on macOS for development and testing.

- Run configuration + build in one shot: `cmake -S . -B out-macos && cmake --build out-macos --target js`
- To rebuild after changes: `cmake --build out-macos`
- To build only JavaScript: `cmake --build out-macos --target js`
- The build output directory is `out-macos/`
- Executable will be `out-macos/vitadeck`
- JavaScript files are copied to `out-macos/js/`
- Requires raylib to be installed via Homebrew: `brew install raylib`
