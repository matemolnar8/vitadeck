# macOS Build Steps

Build the project natively on macOS for development and testing.

- Run configuration + build in one shot: `cmake -S . -B out && cmake --build out --target js`
- To rebuild after changes: `cmake --build out`
- To build only JavaScript: `cmake --build out --target js`
- The build output directory is `out/`
- Executable will be `out/vitadeck`
- JavaScript files are copied to `out/js/`
- Requires raylib to be installed via Homebrew: `brew install raylib`
